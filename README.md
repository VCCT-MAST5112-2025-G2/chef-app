## Design Aspects

The app uses a vibrant and playful color scheme, with a focus on purple and pink tones. The main background color is a deep purple , which creates a sense of warmth and creativity. The navigation buttons and other interactive elements use a bright pink, which provides a nice contrast and makes the app feel energetic.

The menu cards have a dark, transparent background, which makes the text easy to read. The menu item titles are highlighted in a bright pink color , while the descriptions and other details are in a lighter, softer pink.

The profile section and the form for adding new dishes use a light pink background , which creates a friendly and inviting atmosphere. The input fields have a very light pink background , which makes them easy to distinguish from the rest of the form.

Overall, the design is modern, playful, and easy to use, which makes it a great tool for chefs to manage their menus.
